Aether OnRamp
===============

Aether OnRamp provides an incremental path for users to

* First learn about and explore Aether;
* Then develop for and contribute to Aether; 
* And finally deploy and operate Aether.

The version of OnRamp in this repo is no longer supported. You should
instead use the version available at ONF:

https://github.com/opennetworkinglab/aether-onramp

Documentation for that version is available as part of the Aether Guide:

https://docs.aetherproject.org/master/

If you found your way to this README from a printed copy of the Private 5G
book, that version (this repo) is still functional, with online documentation
available by doing the following:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/SystemsApproach/private5g.git
$ cd private5g
$ git checkout book-v1.0
$ make html
```

You can then view the OnRamp Guide at following URL:

```
file:///...your home directory.../private5g/_build/html/software/overview.html
```

But unless you are heavily invested in this earlier version, we recommend
moving to the new version linked above.
