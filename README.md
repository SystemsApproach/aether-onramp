Aether OnRamp
===============

Aether OnRamp is intended to provide an incremental path for users to

* First learn about and play with Aether;
* Then develop for and contribute to Aether; 
* And finally deploy and operate Aether.

Aether OnRamp started as a fork of
[Aether-in-a-Box
(AiaB)](https://docs.aetherproject.org/master/developer/aiab.html#),
but is being refactored to help users step through a sequence of
increasingly complex configurations, culminating with an operational
version that runs 24/7 and supports live 5G workloads.

This is a work-in-progress, starting with how to bring up Aether for
the first time (i.e., today's version is similar to AiaB). Over time,
the plan is for Aether OnRamp to also:

* Enable GitOps deployment tools. 
* Connect physical base stations.
* Enable performance optimizations like SR-IOV.
* Scale in multiple dimensions.
* Integrate with SD-RAN.

An engineering roadmap for Aether OnRamp can be found in the
[GitHub wiki](https://github.com/SystemsApproach/aether-onramp/wiki).

A [Users Guide for Aether OnRamp](https://5g.systemsapproach.org/software/overview.html) 
is included with education material being designed in concert with
Aether OnRamp. This material includes the
[Private 5G](https://5g.systemsapproach.org) and
[Edge Cloud Operations](https://ops.systemsapproach.org) books in the
[Systems Approach Series](https://www.systemsapproach.org/books.html).

If you found your way to this README from a printed copy of the Private 5G
book, then be aware that OnRamp is an active project and has likely changed. 
You can either follow the instructions in the aforementioned 
[Guide](https://5g.systemsapproach.org/software/overview.html), or
you can checkout a tagged version of OnRamp that corresponds to the printed
Appendix by going to the directory you cloned and typing:

``git checkout book-v1.0``
